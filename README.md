# Semantic chunking with header cuts

Branch `chunking/structure-semantic-bge-m3`. Hybrid retrieval (Postgres full-text + vectors) over the Google Cloud Data Analytics course,
built to run on a laptop within a small CPU/RAM budget (no GPU). Postgres + pgvector for storage. Embedding model of
this branch's results: `bge-m3` (int8, ONNX Runtime).

Full description, settings and how to reproduce: [CHUNKING.md](CHUNKING.md). Raw evaluation lines:
[eval/runs/structure-semantic-bge-m3.log](eval/runs/structure-semantic-bge-m3.log).

## Technique applied

Same as the semantic chunker, with one extra cut point:
1. Units and window embeddings as in the semantic chunker.
2. A chunk is cut at a topic shift (90th percentile) or at the 440-token cap, **and also at every `#` header once
   the current chunk already has 100 tokens** (`starts_section and tokens >= min_tokens`).
3. It is one pass over sentences, with no second stage and no merge. The extra cut explains why it makes more and
   smaller chunks than the pure semantic chunker.

## Experiments

Written up in [eval/experiments.md](https://github.com/estvn/GCP-ANALYTICS_RAG/blob/main/eval/experiments.md) (the file on `main` is the complete log):

- **E17**: Grid with a validation set: 6 chunkers x 7 search variants
- **E19**: Full-index evaluation of the three chunkers
- **E21**: How structure and meaning share the cuts
- **E27**: bge-m3 with structure + semantic chunking
- **E29**: All chunking techniques on one common method

## Results (E29: hybrid search, 130 questions, hits / MRR)

| technique | e5-small | bge-m3 |
|---|---|---|
| structural 2400 | 95 / .561 | 107 / .612 |
| semantic | 96 / .517 | 113 / .576 |
| semantic + header cuts | 99 / .557 | 114 / .580 **◀ this branch** |
| community two-stage | 97 / .508 | 113 / .584 |
| user's hybrid (two-stage + merge) | 95 / .552 | 109 / .592 |

Hits are questions answered out of 130, with about 9,000 characters returned per query. Differences under about 8 points
(about 10 of the 130 questions) are not conclusive.
