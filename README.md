# Hybrid chunking (two-stage + merge of neighbours)

Branch `chunking/structure-semantic-merge-bge-m3`. Hybrid retrieval (Postgres full-text + vectors) over the Google Cloud Data Analytics course,
built to run on a laptop within a small CPU/RAM budget (no GPU). Postgres + pgvector for storage. Embedding model of
this branch's results: `bge-m3` (int8, ONNX Runtime).

Full description, settings and how to reproduce: [CHUNKING.md](CHUNKING.md). Raw evaluation lines:
[eval/runs/structure-semantic-merge-bge-m3.log](eval/runs/structure-semantic-merge-bge-m3.log).

## Technique applied

1. **Structural stage:** split by markdown headers.
2. **Semantic stage:** a section above 440 tokens is subdivided by the semantic cut chunker.
3. **Merge step:** embed every piece and repeatedly merge the most similar pair of neighbours in the document. A pair
   merges when its similarity reaches the threshold (a percentile, here 25, of the document's own neighbour
   similarities) or when one side is below 100 tokens, and never past 440 tokens. Merging may cross a section
   boundary; the merged chunk keeps the headers of its first piece. Nothing is discarded.

## Experiments

Written up in [eval/experiments.md](https://github.com/estvn/GCP-ANALYTICS_RAG/blob/main/eval/experiments.md) (the file on `main` is the complete log):

- **E29**: All chunking techniques on one common method

## Results (E29: hybrid search, 130 questions, hits / MRR)

| technique | e5-small | bge-m3 |
|---|---|---|
| structural 2400 | 95 / .561 | 107 / .612 |
| semantic | 96 / .517 | 113 / .576 |
| semantic + header cuts | 99 / .557 | 114 / .580 |
| community two-stage | 97 / .508 | 113 / .584 |
| user's hybrid (two-stage + merge) | 95 / .552 | 109 / .592 **◀ this branch** |

Hits are questions answered out of 130, with about 9,000 characters returned per query. Differences under about 8 points
(about 10 of the 130 questions) are not conclusive.
